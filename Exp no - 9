AIM:To draw the diagrams [usecase, activity, sequence, collaboration, class, statechart,component, deployment, package ] for E-book management system.SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONSL.NO SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION1.0 Hardware Requirements1.1 Software Requirements1.2 Problem Analysis and Project Plan1.3 Project description1.4 Reference1.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:Intel Pentium Processor I3/I51.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:OOAD LABREGISTER NO:Rational rose / Argo UML1.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNINGE-book Management System gives an idea about how books are maintained in theparticular websites. The books that are to be purchased, the books that are to be sold aremaintained here. . Further some additional details of the current books that is available in thestore are also given. E book Management System in this project is done in an authorized way.The password and user id has been set here.1.3 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:This software is designed to manage the books that were read through the internet. Thisconsists of the details of the e-book that were read by the user online. It will be controlled by thecentral system. This system act as a backup of all details together.1.4 REFERENCES:IEEE Software Requirement Specification format.USE CASE DIAGRAM:This diagram will contain the actors, use cases which are given belowActors: user, e-book managementUse case: login ,search books, download ,pay for the books, logout .CLASS DIAGRAM: This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and their operations.CLASSES ATTRIBUTES OPERATIONSInternet Enter id, login, logout Surf book()User Login, logout Surf book()ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:This diagram will have the activities as Start point ,End point, Decision boxes as givenbelow:Activities: Search for the e-book site,search for the book,download bookDecision box: check availabilitySEQUENCE DIAGRAM:This diagram consists of the objects, messages and return messages.Object: User ,E-book management ,InternetCOLLABORATION DIAGRAM:This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained by the completion ofthe sequence diagram and pressing the F5 keySATECHART DIAGRAM:It is a technique to describe the behavior of the system. It describes all the possible statesthat a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for asingle class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects.COMPONENT DIAGRAM:The component diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph of designof figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structuralrelationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure.Dependencies are represented by communication assocationDEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:OOAD LABREGISTER NO:A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the physicaldeployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the allocation ofartifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. E-book managPACKAGE DIAGRAM:OOAD LABREGISTER NO:A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependenciesbetween the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping ofelements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used to show groupsof classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams(CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).There are three types of layer. They areo User interface layero Domain layero Technical services layerPROGRAM CODING:E-BOOK MANAGEMENT:public class e-book management extends internet{public Integer enterid;public Integer verifyuser;public void checkavailability(){}}USER:public class user1 extends internet{public Integer login;public Integer logout;public void surfbooks(){}}CENTRAL SYSTEM:public class central system{ public Integer enterid; public Integer download; public Integer login; public Integer logout; public void v{}public void status(){}RESULT:Thus the draw the diagrams [usecase, activity, sequence, collaboration, class, statechart,component, deployment, package ] for E-book management system.
